Overview
========

Otto uses a routes-like syntax_ to map URLs to code and supports object
traversal. The `WebOb <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/WebOb>`_ library is
supported, but not required (see `using WebOb`_).

You can use the publisher to write web applications. It was designed
with both small and large applications in mind. The documentation
includes a tutorial and examples which show how to solve common
problems (see also the `user's guide`__).

:mod:`Otto` works with Python 2.6 or newer.
