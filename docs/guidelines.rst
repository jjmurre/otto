This section outlines the principles on which this library is built,
which extends to how we'd like to see it evolve.

Library vs Framework

   We believe it's inherent to frameworks to introduce anti-patterns
   and to require a particular development *model*.

   The primary motivation for writing and using frameworks is to
   increase productivity, but it's not clear that this is an actual
   outcome. On the other hand, it is evident that there are actual
   negative effects of working with or within a framework.
